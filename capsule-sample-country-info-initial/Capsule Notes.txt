API Notes
- Using restcountries.com’s country information API
- Country borders are returned as a cc3 country code. For usability, this should be converted to an actual country name. A list of country names and codes can be retrieved with this API call - https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all?fields=name,cca3
- The API supports partial matches, for instance if you search for Korea, you will get both North and South Korea returned. So there needs to be a way for the user to select a country if multiple are returned
- The database includes territories - for instance searching for United States returns both the country of US but also the “United States Virgin Islands” and searching for China returns China and Hong Kong. 
- To accommodate the above, there needs to be a way to get the anticipated results for a country name
